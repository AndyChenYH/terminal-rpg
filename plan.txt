goal of game: rpg game with map, combat, quest system, crafting system, economy
doesn't have to have complex actions, but interesting content is key
maybe get jay to write some story lines for me
regularly update the game with new content (map area, quests, weapons & gears) to make it fun

remember to make plenty of comments!
