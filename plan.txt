goal of game: rpg game with map, combat, quest system, crafting system, economy
doesn't have to have complex actions, but interesting content is key
maybe get jay to write some story lines for me
regularly update the game with new content (map area, quests, weapons & gears) to make it fun

remember to make plenty of comments!

game storyline:
	npc vibing along, monster tries to kill them & village
	player has conscious and unconscious
		internal dialogue, giving hints and ques
		unconscious is big IQ & schemes against player
			unconsioucs wants to kill bad guy so IT can be the bad guy
	seemingly innocent at first, then gets darker because influence from unconscious
		mission become more villanous and evil
		constantly tries to explain its evil actions
	unconscious is the tutorial; teaches player how to craft
-load image from txt file & draw

file reading:
	*will use map<string name, Object> to map to in-code objects referenced in files
		*for example, mp["NPCJoe"] would map to an NPC called joe
		*allows file to reference things using string


development plan:
*world, camera, and side maps
	*camera displays player near the center
	*player movement		
	*implement map class
	*make a portal into another map
	*read in map from txt file
		*including look, and passibility in matrix format
		*use HTML style <> </> tags with nested functions
		*read in resource nodes from map

		*read in portals 
			*give map a name to reference in treemap
		*read in NPC
			*read in dialogue triggers
			*generate lambda function inline
			*can give or receive NONE; make sure to check with conditional
			*can only give or receive one type of item
				*if you want multiple items...do it in another dialogue


-refactor file reading: without the use of lambdas

*npc class
	*name, dialogue triggers when acted upon
	*dialogue system 
		*dialogue class with member variables string, trigger lambda function
		*disables usual key presses when isTalking is true
			*all input is routed with conditional
		*linear progression by pressing 'enter'
			*confirmation of quest is pressing 'enter'
			*player can exit at any time with 'backspace'
		*string is the dialogue description
		*the lambda can give the player a quest

*accept quests from npc

	*anything outside of this small camera will not be processed
		*aka enemies will not move, attacks will not go that far
*stored in a large array

	*each is a Block object, containing passability
		*block looks is simple ascii. some blocks allow players to pass, some don't
