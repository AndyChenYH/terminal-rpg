goal of game: rpg game with map, combat, quest system, crafting system, economy
doesn't have to have complex actions, but interesting content is key
maybe get jay to write some story lines for me
regularly update the game with new content (map area, quests, weapons & gears) to make it fun

remember to make plenty of comments!

development plan:
-world, camera, and side maps
	*camera displays player near the center

-player and inventory system

	-player interaction
		*implement player facing
		*collecting natural resources
			*map display resources
			*resource nodes				
			*disappears after harvesting and regrows in a while
		-talking with npc
			*sets game state to be talking, so player can't move
				*if is talking with npc, display current dialogue box on the right
					*reroute inputs
					*if '`' is detected, stop talking
					*if ' ' is detected, advance to the next dialogue
			-implement dialogues & npc display

-npc class
	-name, dialogue triggers when acted upon
