note: for all AML files except for image files & animation files, you can have extra spaces/tabs and empty lines
the program will also do a basic tag-matching check

map making:
the <basicLook> tag is a must
all cells are initialized to be passable

colors:
you can make new colors and name them in the <colors> tag
format is name followed by rgb values
rgb each go from 0 to 999, inclusive
for example:
purple 500 0 900

there are already a few default colors though:
black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, and default, which is the default background color of the terminal

in the terminal, colors are actually defined as pairs, namely a foreground color and a background color
so for you to actually use colors in the files, you have to create color pairs in the format: 
foreground background

for example:
yellow green

and you can then use them by adding a underscore between them:
like so: yellow_green
